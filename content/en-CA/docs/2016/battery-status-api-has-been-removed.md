As of Firefox 52, the [Battery Status API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API) is no longer available from Web content for privacy reasons, where it could be used by remote trackers for user fingerprinting. It's not known whether there were legitimate use cases in the wild.
